# nonogram-solvers
Nonogram solvers implementing backtracking algorithm and line solving method created specifically for that logic problem.


Run program from the console with chosen board as the argument, e.g.: <br />
`python3 /backtracking/backtracking.py /boards/7.15x5.txt` <br />
`python3 /line-solver/line_solver.py /boards/7.15x5.txt` <br />
